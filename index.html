      <p class="text-muted">Our libraryâ€™s objective is to inculcate the habit of reading; children are introduced to the library and books right from the Kindergarten level. They realize the joys of reading as well as the importance of books, in their formative years itself.
        Reference books are also kept to help students with their course studies. The cataloging and issue procedure in the library is through library cards. Students at St. Xaviers are encouraged not only to pursue reading but also to develop the art of story-telling, enacting and reading aloud.
